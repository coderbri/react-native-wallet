# React Native Wallet App - Changelog

## v0.3.0 - Create Transaction Route
**Release Date**: October 20, 2025

### Summary
- Introduced middleware setup to handle incoming requests and perform pre-processing before sending responses.  
- Added `express.json()` middleware to parse incoming JSON payloads for POST requests.  
- Implemented a custom middleware for debugging to log incoming requests and their HTTP methods to the console.  
- Created the first `POST /api/transactions` route to allow users to add new transactions to the database.  
- Implemented request validation to ensure all required fields (`title`, `amount`, `category`, `user_id`) are provided before insertion.  
- Executed raw SQL `INSERT` queries using the `sql` client from `@neondatabase/serverless` to store new transactions in the `transactions` table.  
- Added structured error handling with proper status codes (400 for bad requests, 500 for internal errors).  
- Tested the route using Postman by sending JSON payloads and verified successful data persistence in Neon PostgreSQL.  
- Confirmed database insertion with automatic `created_at` timestamps generated by PostgreSQL.
